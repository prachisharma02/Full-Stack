NODELIST:
when you do queryselectorall or using elements
    when you inspect and will write...

    const temp=document.queryselectorall('li')  ---> it will select all the li elements 
    and provide you a nodelist which is similar to arrays but not arrays as arrays have map function but 
    nodelist does not have

    so it will not allow you to change the color or any styling by doing like 
    temp.style.color='green'

    BECAUSE IT IS GIVING YOU A LIST CALLED NODELIST SO TO TO THAT WE HAVE TO USE TEMP[0].STYLE...
    ALSO IF WE WANT ALL THE ELEMENTS TO BE GREEN THEN YOU CAN DO FOREACH METHOD  -->

        SO TO DO THAT
        const temp=document.queryselectorall('li')
        temp.forEach(function (l) {
            l.style.color='green'   
        }) 

HTML COLLECTION:
when you do getelementbyclassname 
it is not like nodelist you cant apply foreach so convert it into arrays by doing
Arrays.from(htnlcollectionvarname)
and then apply any styling
