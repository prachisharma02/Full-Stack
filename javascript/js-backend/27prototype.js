//prototypal behaviour of js: js will not stop finding the value of any variable or object
//if it not directly available then it will move to outer layer to find the value
//until it gets the null value

//first thing we know that everything in js is object but but how??

//js mechanism is if there is arrays ,string or functions then they are arrays string and functions also they are
//object as well
