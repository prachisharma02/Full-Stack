API : APPLICTION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE

when we(Third party) want to access the database of an organisation 
but it's not safe the we uses API which gives security and provide a set of codes
called programming interface with witch we can use their data without accessing the database

example: to login through facebook in our (third party app) but facebook will not give access to its 
database so there API is used which provide a interface to login and we can use their data to login 
without accessing their database.
