DIFFRENCE BETWEEN FRAMEWORK AND LIBRARIES

LIBRARIES are set of codes that we can directly call
and FRAMEWORK can't be called directly but it itself calls the code and FRAMEWORKis is of set of LIBRARIES

FRAMEWORK is a software a application but LIBRARIES is not

LIBRARIES are the collection of pre defined functions when we want to use it we just  call that function

In LIBRARIES we have the control on the flow of execution as we call the code here and decides the flow
how to execute by calling in our way example REACTJS but  
in FRAMEWORK we write the code but FRAMEWORK calls the code and it has control on the flow of execution 
it decide when to call what code example ANGULARJS

FRAMEWORK provides the design architecture we just write the code

Also

IDE INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT IS JUST A APPLICTION IT JUST PROVIDES CODE EDITOR TOOLS LIKE 
COMPILER LOADER AND DEBUGGING TOOLS
