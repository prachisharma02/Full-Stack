Why to learn raect?
    so we all know that --> to make easy building complex ui's 

why react was created?
    it started with facebook
    when we opened facebook there was one notification icon, msg icon and message chat center of complete page 
    so what happened was there arise an issue called ghost msg problem also called as phantom message
ghost msg: if there are 3 chats and I have opened 1 chat then the notification icon is still showing it 3 
            so there comes an issue
             
problem: no consistency in ui 

so there require an interaction between js-state_variable and dom_ui

NOW a big question is ?  that we know react is SPA there is only one  index.html file but there js is not loaded as 
script tag(it is complusory to load js file to use the functionality)

So How It WORKS?
ANSWER : React contain scripts in package.json file and those scripts load the js file dynamically you can check 
out by inspect and page source

And in case of vite js file is directly loaded in index.html file

React and Vite both are similar in working
Difference is some of the rules in vite
vite is 
-->file structure different no as such public folder
-->light weight
-->easily installed
-->lesser and necessary libraries installed
------->RULES
-->file name must be saved with jsx extension not js if js file is there and in react we can use both 
--> file name starts with capital letter lite will give you error but react will not give you error 
    but also it does not work accordingly

    CREATEROOT: METHOD CREATED THE REACT TREE TO DIFF

ALL THE STORY REGARDING VIRTUAL DOM FIBRE AND RECONCILATION :
    SO WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN VIRTUAL DOM : THAT MEANS A ANOTHER TREE (RAECT TREE THAT COMES FROM CREATEROOT METHOD )IS CREATED WHILE THERE IS A CHANGE HAPPEND IN THE DOM 
    TREE AND THAT INCLUDES A DIFF(DIFFRENCE BETWEEN PREVIOUS AND CURRENT) WAS MEASURED AND THOSE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE
    ARE THEN ADDED TO ACTUAL TREE THIS LEADS TO QUICK CHANGES IN THE UI 
BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE IS ANY ANIMATION LAYOUT AND GESTURES REACT STILL CHANGES QUICK THIS WAS LEADING AN 
    ISSUE IN ANIMATIONS (FOR EX: FIRST CHANGE UI WAS CHANGING THE AGAIN CHANGE THEN AGAIN SO UI IS CHANGING AT EVERY 
    CHANGE 
    BUT IN ANIMATION WE ONLY WANT THE FIRST AND THIRD CHANGE BUT DUE TO VIRTUAL DOM WE WERE GETTING SECOND ALSO  )
SO 
FIBRE ALGO COMES IN
ALGORITHM USED BEHIND UPDATING VIRTUAL DOM
(STORY : REACT KA FATAFAT CHANGE KRNA SAB DIKKAT KRTA THA KABHI KABHI JAISE KOI NETWORK CALL HAI JAISE 
ABHI EK CALL AAI VO UPDATE HORHI THI KI EK AUR  AAGYI FIR UI UPDATE AESE HE 3-4 BAR HUA AUR HME BS FINAL CALL 
VALA UI P CHANGE KRNA THA TO DIKKAT ISILIY)
FIBRE IS A WELL IMPLEMENTED ALGORITHM THAT ALLOWS UP TP PAUSE AND ABORT AND MANY OTHER FEATURES LIKE 
Ability to assign priority to different types of updates 
LIKE IN ANIMATIO =N IT ONLY DISPLAYS FIRST AND LAST

HYDRATION: HTML CSS IS LOADED HYDRATION IS A PROCESS OF INJECTING JS INTO CODE LIKE 
BUTTON IS DISPLAYED BUT ITS FUNCTIONALITY INJECTION
