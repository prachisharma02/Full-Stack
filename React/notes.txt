Why to learn raect?
    so we all know that --> to make easy building complex ui's 

why react was created?
    it started with facebook
    when we opened facebook there was one notification icon, msg icon and message chat center of complete page 
    so what happened was there arise an issue called ghost msg problem also called as phantom message
ghost msg: if there are 3 chats and I have opened 1 chat then the notification icon is still showing it 3 
            so there comes an issue
             
problem: no consistency in ui 

so there require an interaction between js-state_variable and dom_ui

NOW a big question is ?  that we know react is SPA there is only one  index.html file but there js is not loaded as 
script tag(it is complusory to load js file to use the functionality)

So How It WORKS?
ANSWER : React contain scripts in package.json file and those scripts load the js file dynamically you can check 
out by inspect and page source

And in case of vite js file is directly loaded in index.html file

React and Vite both are similar in working
Difference is some of the rules in vite
vite is 
-->file structure different no as such public folder
-->light weight
-->easily installed
-->lesser and necessary libraries installed
------->RULES
-->file name must be saved with jsx extension not js if js file is there and in react we can use both 
--> file name starts with capital letter lite will give you error but react will not give you error 
    but also it does not work accordingly
