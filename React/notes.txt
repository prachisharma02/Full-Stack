Why to learn raect?
    so we all know that --> to make easy building complex ui's 

why react was created?
    it started with facebook
    when we opened facebook there was one notification icon, msg icon and message chat center of complete page 
    so what happened was there arise an issue called ghost msg problem also called as phantom message
ghost msg: if there are 3 chats and I have opened 1 chat then the notification icon is still showing it 3 
            so there comes an issue
             
problem: no consistency in ui 

so there require an interaction between js-state_variable and dom_ui
